Hari Sekhon's Ambari Blueprint Samples
======================================

### PyTools ```ambari_blueprints.py``` templates ###

Generated by the ambari_blueprints.py tool found in the top level of this repo from various generic test clusters.

Beware the default password is set to ```test``` - you should change hostmappings*.json.

Also note that the high degree of variation in cluster topologies when combined with the large number of components especially in multi-HA deployments makes this less portable than you would expect and should not be taken as-is for production - you should hire an experienced Hadoop expert.
