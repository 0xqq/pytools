Hari Sekhon's Ambari Blueprint Samples
======================================

### PyTools ```ambari_blueprints.py``` templates ###

Generated by the ambari_blueprints.py tool found in the top level of this repo from various generic test clusters.

Beware the default password is set to ```test``` - must modify hostmappings*.json to a real password.

Also note that the high degree of variation in cluster topologies when combined with the large number of components especially in multi-HA deployments makes this less portable than you would expect and should not be taken as-is for production - you should hire an experienced Hadoop expert.

Some features will not work in different versions of Ambari < 2.1.0 (eg. predicates and host counts) or require extra configuration eg. for various services HA deployments. You must read all the Ambari documentation thoroughly.

I am not supporting these Blueprints, please do not raise issues for this part of the repo. This is only for referencing for my own usage as I modify it to my clients needs while consulting.
